# GitHub Action for BuildPulse [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Workshop64/buildpulse-action/main/LICENSE)

Easily connect your GitHub Actions CI workflows to [BuildPulse][buildpulse.io] to help you identify and eliminate flaky tests.

## Usage

1. Locate the BuildPulse credentials for your account at [buildpulse.io][]
2. In the GitHub settings for your repository, [create an encrypted secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets) named `BUILDPULSE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and set its value to the `BUILDPULSE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` for your account
3. Create another encrypted secret named `BUILDPULSE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and set its value to the `BUILDPULSE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for your account
4. Add a step to your GitHub Actions workflow to use this action to send your test results to BuildPulse:

    ```yaml
    steps:
    - name: Check out code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Run tests
      run: echo "Run your tests and generate XML reports for your test results"

    - name: Upload test results to BuildPulse for flaky test detection
      if: '!cancelled()' # Run this step even when the tests fail. Skip if the workflow is cancelled.
      uses: Workshop64/buildpulse-action@main
      with:
        account: <buildpulse-account-id>
        repository: <buildpulse-repository-id>
        path: <path-to-xml-reports>
        key: ${{ secrets.BUILDPULSE_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        secret: ${{ secrets.BUILDPULSE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    ```
